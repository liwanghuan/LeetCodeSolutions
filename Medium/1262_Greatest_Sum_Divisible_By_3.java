 //1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three
 /* 
 Given an array nums of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

 Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

// Solution: Find the largest number now for every number added so far. dp = remaining of divided by 3 of 0, 1, 2


 public int maxSumDivThree(int[] A) {
        int[] dp = new int[]{0, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE};
        for (int a : A) {
            int[] dp2 = new int[3];
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
                dp2[(i + a) % 3] = Math.max(dp[(i + a) % 3], dp[i] + a);
            dp = dp2;
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
